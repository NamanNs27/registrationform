The form includes fields for First Name, Last Name, Username, E-mail, Password (with show/hide functionality), Phone Number (with country code and number), Country (dropdown), City (dropdown), Pan No., and Aadhar No. The form displays error messages for invalid inputs, disables submission until all fields are correctly filled, and shows all the filled details on a new route upon successful submission.
